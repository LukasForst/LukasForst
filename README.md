# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Lukas](https://lukas.forst.dev) - a senior software engineer passionate about building useful stuff. Currently on a mission to make your infrastructure more secure with [Recon Wave](https://reconwave.com/).

For the past seven years of my professional experience, I have worked with whole range of languages,
from C to Typescript. Nowadays I mostly enjoy working with Kotlin and Rust.
I primarly work on the lowlevel backend stuff, but I can do quite a lot in React, Vue.js and Svelte although I'm pretty bad at CSS.

During the time I created some small libraries such as
[Katlib](https://github.com/LukasForst/katlib), [Exposed Upsert](https://github.com/LukasForst/exposed-upsert), [Ktor Plugins](https://github.com/LukasForst/ktor-plugins) and [Camerge](https://github.com/LukasForst/camerge).
