# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Lukas](https://lukas.forst.dev) - a senior software engineer passionate about building useful stuff.

For the past seven years of my professional experience, I have worked with whole range of languages,
from C to Typescript. Nowadays I mostly enjoy working with Kotlin and Rust.
I primarly work on the backend stuff, but I can do quite a lot in React and Vue.js,
although I'm pretty bad at CSS.

During the time I worked with Kotlin, I created some small libraries such as
[Katlib](https://github.com/LukasForst/katlib), [Exposed Upsert](https://github.com/LukasForst/exposed-upsert)
and [Ktor Plugins](https://github.com/LukasForst/ktor-plugins).
Now I'm trying to find time to simplify working with multiple calendars at once with
[Camerge](https://github.com/LukasForst/camerge).

Experience:
- [CDN77](https://www.cdn77.com/) - designed and built [edge computing platform](https://www.cdn77.com/blog/empowering-control-with-edge-computing) from scratch, handling 50 Tbps of traffic on 2k+ servers
- [Mild Blue](https://mild.blue/) - co-founded company and built first health care software utilizing AI algorithms
- [Wire](https://wire.com/) - created many integrations into Wire platform, was taking care of billing platform and worked on cryptography libraries such as [cryptobox4j](https://github.com/wireapp/cryptobox4j)
- [Blindspot](https://blindspot.ai/) - worked on end-to-end solutions utilizing mathematical optimization algorithms

I firmly believe that we should make the internet more secure & private, and that's why I help people
from [StratosphereIPS](https://www.stratosphereips.org/). I'm also Teaching Assistant at [FEE CTU](https://fel.cvut.cz/) helping with master's coures
[Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b231/courses/bsy/start).

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk! I live in UTC+1 time zone.
