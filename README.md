# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Lukas](https://lukas.forst.dev) - a senior software engineer passionate about building useful stuff.

My `day_job` is designing & implementing edge computing platform for a CDN. I make Wasm go brrrr
under 50 Tbps of traffic on 1.5k+ servers. I'm essentially modifying Nginx code to be able to execute Wasm __fast__.
Using Rust, C and Lua.

For the past six years of my professional experience, I have worked mainly with
Kotlin, C#, Java, Python, Rust, C, Lua and Typescript, with some small projects in Go.
In the past, I primarily worked with Kotlin and lately with Rust and C.
I enjoy working on the backend services, but I can do quite a lot in React and Vue.js,
although I'm pretty bad at CSS.

During the time I worked with Kotlin, I created some small libraries such as
[Katlib](https://github.com/LukasForst/katlib), [Exposed Upsert](https://github.com/LukasForst/exposed-upsert)
and [Ktor Plugins](https://github.com/LukasForst/ktor-plugins).
Now I'm trying to find time to simplify working with multiple calendars at once with
[Camerge](https://github.com/LukasForst/camerge).

In the past years, I worked in [Wire](https://wire.com), where I lead a team working on
Wire for Teams and another working on modular [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security)
backend. I also helped to bring to life many Wire's libraries such as
[Cryptobox4j](https://github.com/wireapp/cryptobox4j), [Xenon](https://github.com/wireapp/xenon),
[Helium](https://github.com/wireapp/helium), [Lithium](https://github.com/wireapp/lithium),
[Roman](https://github.com/wireapp/roman), multiplatform [Kalium](https://github.com/wireapp/kalium)
and a lot of Wire integrations created in [Kotlin](https://github.com/wireapp/poll-bot),
[Java](https://github.com/wireapp/echo-bot), [Python](https://github.com/wireapp/charon), and even
[Deno](https://github.com/wireapp/admin-broadcast).
I was also managing two K8s clusters and do a lot of DevOps, automating everything with GitHub Actions,
Docker, and Helm.

I co-founded [Mild Blue](https://mild.blue), where we're building cool things based on the latest
research for hospitals. I helped to create [covid-vaxx](https://github.com/mild-blue/covid-vaxx),
[TXMatching](https://github.com/mild-blue/txmatching), and a lot of other things that,
sadly need to stay closed source. I've worked on Python, Java, Kotlin, C#, and PHP backends and mobile apps
in Ionic, React Native, and Flutter. I also created some native plugins in Swift and Kotlin and managed
our infrastructure on AWS with Terraform. I sold most of the shares in 2022 and nowadays I'm consulting
challenging technical problems and business solutions.

Before all of that I worked in [Blindspot](https://blindspot.ai/) on AI solutions - mostly using Kotlin,
Python and C#.

I firmly believe that we should make the internet more secure & private, and that's why I help people
from [StratosphereIPS](https://www.stratosphereips.org/) with their
[Slips](https://github.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS), and I built
[Fides](https://github.com/LukasForst/fides).
I'm also Teaching Assistant at [FEE CTU](https://fel.cvut.cz/) helping with master's coures
Introduction to Cybersecurity.

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk! I live in UTC+1 time zone.
